This is the code and dataset of BPDA.  

Due to space limitations, the dataset will also be uploaded to google cloud drive at the following link (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1VDz2CHjNUjqU8mUAf2FDhwpKwDyunjzV?usp=drive_link).  

In the Dataset folder, Real-dataset contains SaTC Dataset and BPDA Dataset (which have some overlap and are therefore placed in a unified folder), Loop-Dataset is the Loop Dataset described in the paper, which contains the actual firmware, custom-compiled files, and Datacon2023 dataset.
